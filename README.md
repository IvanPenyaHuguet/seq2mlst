  ## Usage and Options
  ### Input File Formats
  
  The command line version of seq2mlst supports the following file formats as input:
  
1. **Nucleotide sequences in fasta or multifasta format** (1 fasta file per genome or multiple genomes per fasta file)

2. **Draft genome contigs and scaffolds in fasta format** (1 fasta file per genome)

3. **Paired-end ILLUMINA reads in gzipped fastq (.fastq.gz) format** (two separate fastq.gz files per genome, one for forward 
reads and one for reverse reads)

4. **Single-end ILLUMINA reads in gzipped fastq (.fastq.gz) format** (one fastq.gz file per genome)

5. **Paired-end or single-end ILLUMINA reads in sra format** (one sra file per genome)

6. **Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accession numbers corresponding to genomes sequenced with paired-end or single-end ILLUMINA
reads** (one SRA accession number per genome)

### Required Arguments

seq2mlst can be run from your terminal with the following command line:
  
```
seq2mlst -t [input data type] -i [input file(s)] -o [output directory] -m "Genus species" [options...]
```

Required arguments are:
  
  
**-t/-\-type [seq, pe, se, sra, sra-get]**
Input data type. Specify the format of the input data using one of the following strings: seq (a file in fasta or multifasta
format), pe (ILLUMINA paired-end reads, forward and reverse, in two separate fastq.gz files), se (ILLUMINA single-end reads in
one fastq.gz file), sra (Single- or paried-end ILLUMINA reads in one SRA file), sra-get (SRA accession number associated with 
a genome sequenced using single- or paried-end ILLUMINA reads)

**-i/-\-input [string]**
Path to input fasta file, fastq.gz file(s), sra file, or SRA accession number. For paired-end ILLUMINA reads in separate 
files, the path to the fastq.gz file containing forward reads should be specified first, followed by the path to the fastq.gz 
file containing reverse reads, with the two paths separated by a single space.

**-o/-\-output [string]**
Path to desired output directory. Specify the path to the output directory where a results directory (seq2mlst_final_results)
containing output files will be created.

**-m/-\-mlst [string]**
Bacterial database to use for MLST, surrounded by quotation marks, e.g. "Salmonella enterica", "Staphylococcus aureus", 
"Listeria monocytogenes", etc.


### Optional Arguments

Options that can be specified in seq2mlst include the following:
  
**-\-draft_genome**
For use with a draft genome (contigs or scaffolds) in fasta format (-\-input my_contigs.fasta -\-type seq). 
If -\-draft_genome is included in the command, seq2mlst creates a pseudochromosome by concatenating contigs or scaffolds 
in a fasta file and inserting a spacer sequence ("NNnnNNnnNNnnNNnn") between them. This option is ommitted by default.

**-\-spades_m [integer]**
Memory limit for SPAdes in Gb. Optional argument for use with ILLUMINA reads (-\-type pe, -\-type se, -\-type sra, or 
-\-type sra-get). seq2mlst passes this parameter to the -m/-\-memory option in SPAdes. Default is set to 250, the default 
for SPAdes.

**-\-spades_t [integer]**
Number of threads for SPAdes. Optional argument for use with ILLUMINA reads (-\-type pe, -\-type se, -\-type sra, or 
-\-type sra-get). seq2mlst passes this parameter to the -t/-\-threads option in SPAdes. Default is set to 16, the default 
for SPAdes.

**-\-spades_k [integer,integer,integer,...]**
Comma-separated list of k-mer sizes to be used for SPAdes (all values must be odd, less than 128 and listed in ascending 
order). Optional argument for use with ILLUMINA reads (-\-type pe, -\-type se, -\-type sra, or -\-type sra-get). seq2mlst 
passes this parameter to the -k option in SPAdes. Default is set to 77.
Note: We recommend selecting optimum k-mer size(s) for your specific data set by consulting the SPAdes documentation. 
Currently, SPAdes recommends using -k 21,33,55,77 for 150 bp ILLUMINA paired-end reads, and -k 21,33,55,77,99,127 for 
250 bp ILLUMINA paired-end reads.

## Output Directories and Files
  
A single seq2mlst run will deposit the following in your specified output directory (-\-output):
  
**seq2mlst_final_results**
*directory*
Final results directory in which seq2mlst deposits all of its output files. seq2mlst creates this directory in your specified
output directory (-\-output) 

***your_genome_final_results.txt***
*file*
Final results text file, 1 per input genome. seq2mlst creates this final results text file, which contains a tab-separated 
line, containing the isolate's sequence type (ST), if available, and the corresponding allelic types (AT). The best-matching 
allele is reported at each locus; an allele that does not match with 100\% identity or coverage is denoted by an asterisk 
(\*), while an allele that is not detected in the genome at the given e-value threshold is denoted by "?". If a sequence type
cannot be determined using the best-matching allelic types, a "?" is listed in its place. A ST that is detemined using any 
best-matching alleles that did not match with 100\% identity or coverage is denoted by \*, regardless of whether all 7 
alleles could be associated with a ST or not.

**genefiles**
*directory*
Directory in which seq2mlst deposits genefiles, (multi)fasta files which contain the sequences of all genes detected in 
a run. seq2mlst creates this directory within the seq2mlst_final_results directory within your specified output directory 
(output_directory/seq2mlst_final_results/genefiles).

***some_gene_genefile.fasta***
*file*
seq2mlst genefiles, (multi)fasta files which contain the sequences of all genes detected in a run. 1 file per each allele 
is created files are created, and if seq2mlst is run using more than 1 genome as input (either in multifasta format, or if 
seq2mlst is run in a loop), genes from each genome are aggregated together in each genefile. These files are formatted so you
can easily input them into your favorite aligner, phylogenetic tree construction program, the NCBI BLAST server, etc.

**isolatefiles**
*directory*
Directory in which seq2mlst deposits results directories for individual genomes. seq2mlst creates this directory within the 
seq2mlst_final_results directory within your specified output directory 
(output_directory/seq2mlst_final_results/isolatefiles).

***your_genome_results***
*directory*
Directory in which seq2mlst deposits additional results files for each input genome. seq2mlst creates this directory within 
the isolatefiles directory (output_directory/seq2mlst_final_results/isolatefiles/*your_genome*_results). Within this 
directory, you'll find detailed tab-separated results files for each typing analysis performed, as well as fasta files 
containing genes extracted from the genome in question.

Disclaimer: seq2mlst is...pretty neat! However, no tool is perfect, and seq2mlst cannot definitively prove whether an isolate is of a particular sequence type or not. As always, interpret your results with caution. We are not responsible for taxonomic misclassifications, misclassifications of an isolate's pathogenic or antimicrobial resistance potential, and/or misinterpretations (biological, statistical, or otherwise) of seq2mlst results.
